README.txt - a concise, short README.txt file, corresponding to the "user guide". This file should contain:

DESCRIPTION - Describe the package in a few paragraphs

INSTALLATION - How to install and setup your code

EXECUTION - How to run a demo on your code

DEMO VIDEO - [Optional, but recommended]
Include the URL of a 1-minute *unlisted* YouTube video in this txt file. The video would show how to install and execute your system/tool/approach (e.g, from typing the first command to compile, to system launching, and running some examples). Feel free to speed up the video if needed (e.g., remove less relevant video segments). This video is optional (i.e., submitting a video does not increase scores; not submitting one does not decrease scores). However, we recommend teams to try and create such a video, because making the video helps teams better think through what they may want to write in the README.txt, and generally how they want to "sell" their work.


TODO: Directories to create for submission
DOC - a folder called DOC (short for “documentation”) containing:
teamXXXreport.pdf - Your report writeup in PDF format; can be created using any software, e.g., latex, Word.
teamXXXposter.pdf - Your final poster.
CODE - All your code should be added here. Make sure that your package includes only the absolutely necessary set of files.
