But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.}

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authorative” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages” that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.},

Github is now the most popular social coding platform and project hosting service. Software developers of various levels keep   entering Github, and use Github to save their public and private software projects. The large amounts of software developers and software repositories on Github are posing new challenges to the world of software engineering. This paper tries to tackle   one of the important problems: analyzing the importance and influence of Github repositories. We proposed a HITS based influence analysis on graphs that represent the star relationship between Github users and repositories. A weighted version of HITS    is applied to the overall star graph, and generates a different set of top influential repositories other than the results from standard version of HITS algorithm. We also conduct the influential analysis on per-month star graph, and study the monthly   influence ranking of top repositories.}

Analysis of data representing the social interactions of Github users can reveal a number of interesting features. In this paper, we analyze the data to understand user social influence on the platform. Specifically, we propose a Following-Star-Fork-Activity based approach to measure user influence in the Github developer social network. We first preprocess the Github data, and construct the social network. Then, we analyze user influence in the social network, in terms of popularity, centrality, content value, contribution and activity. Finally, we analyze the correlation of different user influence measures, and use Borda Count to comprehensively quantify user influence and verify the results.}

  abstract  = {Influence in social networks has been extensively studied for collaborative-filtering recommendations and marketing purposes. We are interested in the notion of influence in Software Social Networks (SSNs); more specifically, we want to answer the following questions: 1) What does "influence" mean in SSNs? Given the variety of types of interactions supported in these networks and the abundance of centrality-type metrics, what is the nature of the influence captured by these matrics? 2) Are there silos of influence in these platforms or does influence span across thematic boundaries?To investigate these two questions, we first conducted an in-depth comparison of three influence metrics, number of followers, number of forked projects, and number of project watchers in GitHub1 (the largest code-sharing and version-control system). Next, we examined how the influence of the most influential software-engineering people in GitHub is spread over different programming languages.Our results indicate (a) that the three influence metrics capture two major characteristics: popularity and content value (code reusability) and (b) that the influence of influentials is spread over more than one programming language, but there is no specific trend toward any two programming languages.},

Researchers are starting to mine the information stored in GitHub's event logs, trying to understand how its users employ the site to collaborate on software. However, so far there have been no studies describing the quality and properties of the data available from GitHub. We document the results of an empirical study aimed at understanding the characteristics of the repositories in GitHub and how users take advantage of GitHub's main features---namely commits, pull requests, and issues. Our results indicate that, while GitHub is a rich source of data on software development, mining GitHub for research purposes should take various potential perils into consideration. We show, for example, that the majority of the projects are personal and inactive; that GitHub is also being used for free storage and as a Web hosting service; and that almost 40% of all pull requests do not appear as merged, even though they were. We provide a set of recommendations for software engineering researchers on how to approach the data in GitHub.},

  abstract  = {The team aspects of software engineering have been a subject of great interest since early work by Fred Brooks and others: how well do people work together in teams? why do people join teams? what happens if teams are distributed? Recently, the emergence of project ecosystems such as GitHub have created an entirely new, higher level of organization. GitHub supports numerous teams; they share a common technical platform (for work activities) and a common social platform (via following, commenting, etc). We explore the GitHub evidence for socialization as a precursor to joining a project, and how the technical factors of past experience and social factors of past connections to team members of a project affect productivity both initially and in the long run. We find developers preferentially join projects in GitHub where they have pre-existing relationships; furthermore, we find that the presence of past social connections combined with prior experience in languages dominant in the project leads to higher productivity both initially and cumulatively. Interestingly, we also find that stronger social connections are associated with slightly less productivity initially, but slightly more productivity in the long run.},
